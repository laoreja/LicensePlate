# License Plate Detection and Character Segmentation
My implementation of detection is not a robust system. It's purpose is to prove that better slant/skew corrections in the detection step boosts performance in the following character segmentation step.

The License Plate Segmentation system was developed and tested in Xcode, MAC OS X.

The License Plate Detection system was developed and tested in CLion, MAC OS X.

# Reports

My thorough reports in *Chinese* are uploaded. See [Report for License Plate Character Segmentation](https://github.com/laoreja/LicensePlate/blob/master/%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E%E5%9E%82%E7%9B%B4%E6%8A%95%E5%BD%B1%E7%9A%84%E8%BD%A6%E7%89%8C%E5%88%86%E5%89%B2.pdf) and [Report for License Plate detection](https://github.com/laoreja/LicensePlate/blob/master/%E9%A2%9C%E8%89%B2%E5%AE%9A%E4%BD%8D%E4%B8%8E%E5%80%BE%E6%96%9C%E5%81%8F%E7%A7%BB%E7%9F%AB%E6%AD%A3.pdf). They should really help you understand my system or help you play with computer vision algorithms on license plate even if you do not look at my code.
